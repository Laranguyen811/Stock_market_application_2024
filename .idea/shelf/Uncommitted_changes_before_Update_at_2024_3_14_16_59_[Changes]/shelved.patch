So, this will classify only the most\r\nextreme 0.7% of the data as outliers. \r\ne) In different fields, we may use different multipliers instead of 1.5, depending on how inclusive or exclusive they want\r\nthe outlier definition to be. \r\n- Outliers:\r\nMSFT: none\r\nGOOG: none\r\nAMZN: none \r\nAAPL: none\r\nSAP: none\r\nMETA: 16\r\n005930_KS: none\r\nIBM: 82\r\nORCL: 49\r\nBABA: none\r\nTCEHY: 15\r\nNVDA: 143\r\nTSM: none\r\nNFLX: none\r\nTSLA: none\r\nCRM: none\r\nADBE: none\r\nPYPL: 270\r\nOutliers in the 'Close' prices may occur for various reasons: market volatility, significant news or events, earning reports (investors\r\nuse earnings reports to gauge a company's future profitability and adjust their investment decisions accordingly earnings per share is a common\r\nratio investors use to assess a company's profitability, P/E (price to earnings) ratio => calculated by dividing the share price of a company\r\nby its EPS, a high P/E ration compared to others in the same industry may indicate that the company is overvalued, while a low P/E could indidate that\r\nthe company is undervalued, earnings yield is an inverse of the P/E ratio), changes in market sentiments, data entry errors.\r\nHighly unlikely in this case that there will be data entry errors. \r\nResearchers often view outliers as 'data problems', and they tend to overlook the fact that outliers can be substantively interesting\r\nand studied as unique phenomena that could lead to novel theoretical insights. There is, therefore, a need for a better understanding\r\nand clear guidelines regarding the following 3 issues: a) How to define them. b) how to identify them, c) how to handle them. \r\nHow to best handle outliers:\r\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/10.1177/1094428112470848/full\r\n\r\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23322039.2022.2066762\r\n\r\n- Meta: outliers from the period of 2021-07-26 till 2021-09-09 =>  The Dow Jones Industrial Average also experienced some changes during this period\r\n(could be due to economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in investor sentiment) => maybe Covid-19, more people relying on online communication?\r\nAmid ongoing concerns about its struggles to adequately protect data and limit hate speech, \r\nmisinformation and other disreputable content, the world’s largest social network confronted a flood of issues this year,\r\nbeginning with the Capitol insurrection and its subsequent decision to indefinitely suspend then-President Trump. \r\nTroves of documents later leaked by former Facebook employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed more damaging information about the impact of the company’s platforms on young users’ mental health. \r\nFinally, Facebook announced that it was rebranding itself \r\nas Meta to reflect a focus on the metaverse, a virtual reality space where users interact with each other amid a computer-generated environment.\r\nBut the outliers occurred before its rebranding. \r\nWhy outliers during this period? => natural variation or something else? (need more investigation)\r\n- IBM: outliers occurred from 2014-01-07 till 2020-03-23. 2014-2017: Bull Market Continues: The stock market, as represented by indices like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the S&P/ASX 200\r\ngenerally trended upwards during this period. => corresponding to IBM's upper bound outliers.\r\n2018: Increased Volatility: The year 2018 saw increased market volatility, with the DJIA and other indices experiencing several notable dips. \r\nThis was due in part to concerns about global trade tensions and changes in monetary policy\r\n2019: Market Recovery: Despite the volatility in 2018, the market bounced back in 2019, with the DJIA and other indices reaching new all-time highs\r\n2020: COVID-19 Impact: The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on the stock market. \r\nIn March 2020, the DJIA and other global indices experienced dramatic drops, marking the end of the bull market that had begun in 2009 => corresponding to the lower bound outliers from 2020-03-16 till 2020-03-23 \r\n\r\n\r\n***Correlation***\r\n- For all the stocks, Open, High, Low, Close and Adj Close are all correlated to each other (1). \r\nThere are no correlations between Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close with Volume. \r\n\r\n***Q-Q Plots***\r\n- None of the stock data follow a normal distribution\r\n\r\n*** Linear relationships***\r\n- Seaborn pair plots show that in all companies, \"Open\", \"High\",\"Low\",Close\" and \"Adj Close\" all show \r\nlinear relationships with each other. No strong relationships between \"Volume\" and the rest of other features exhibited (need \r\nto calculate correlation coefficients to make sure)

+  - MSFT:
+        - PC1 has the highest explained variance => highly influential (variance indicating stock market price), also has a positive relationship with 'Open',
+  'High','Low','Close','Adj Close' and a very slight inverse relationship with 'Volume'.
+          The second highest is PC2(variance indicating Volume) - relatively lowly influential, having a significantly positive relationship with Volume.
+          The rest has minimal impacts on the dataset. Nonetheless, PC3 has a highly inverse relationship with 'Open' 
+          and a moderately positive relationship with 'Adj Close'.
+          PC4 has a highly positive relationship with 'High' and a highly inverse relationship with 'Low'. PC5 has a moderately positive 
+          relationship with 'Close' and a highly inverse relationship with 'Adj Close'. PC6 has a moderately positive relationship with 'Close'
